<span class="markdown">Risk management documentation for medical devices has traditionally been submitted on paper, which unnecessarily increases the workload of notified bodies when assessing such documentation for certification. The KIMEDS project (AI assisted risk management for medical devices) aims at establishing a way to digitally represent and transmit risk management information. More specifically, we propose to annotate risk management information with semantical properties to allow for automated sanity checks of submitted risk management documentation. The KIMEDS Ontology provides classes and relationships to be used in such semantical annotation.</span>
