# Riskman Ontology & Shapes

The Riskman Ontology & Shapes defines various notions related to risk management for medical devices. It builds on terms from ISO 14971. The central notion of the 
Riskman Ontology & Shapes is that of a Safe Design Argument (SDA), a reusable artifact that aims to demonstrate how a specific hazard occurring with a device (and possibly further context information and assumptions) has been mitigated.
